            <dive class="retrievalpractice">
                <h4>Retrieval Practice</h4>
                <p>The act of trying to remember ideas, through techniques like flash cards to practice tests, actually helps make it easier to remember those ideas and connect them to each other.</p>
            </dive>
            <dive class="SpacedPractice">
                <h4>Spaced Practice</h4>
                <p>This simple method of spacing out your studying makes a big difference in helping to form lasting memories</p>
            </dive>

            <dive class="Elaboration">
                <h4>Elaboration</h4>
                <p>Use your own words and add details to the concepts you’re learning to make them your own and make it easier to recall them later.</p>
            </dive>

            <dive class="Interleaving">
                <h4>Interleaving</h4>
                <p>Instead of studying the same things in the same order over and over, try mixing things up with Interleaving. </p>
            </dive>

            <dive class="ConcreteExample">
                <h4>Concrete Example</h4>
                <p>It’s easier to remember ideas that we can visualize and connect to ideas we already know. Learning and creating specific examples of abstract concepts does just that.</p>
            </dive>

            <dive class="DualCoding">
                <h4>Dual Coding</h4>
                <p>Combine visuals like pictures, diagrams or your own drawings, with text gives your brain more to latch on to and more pathways to remember.</p>
